<b>Project Title: Obys Agency Website Clone</b><br> 
About The Project This repository hosts a pixel-perfect, interactive frontend clone of the award-winning Obys Agency website. The project serves as a showcase of modern web development techniques, focusing heavily on immersive user experience (UX), smooth animations, and WebGL-based interactions.

<b><b>Key Features</b></b>

* Advanced Animations: Utilizes GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and ScrollTrigger for complex, timeline-based entrance animations and scroll-dependent effects.

* Smooth Scrolling: Implemented Locomotive Scroll to create a fluid, inertia-based scrolling experience with parallax elements.

* WebGL Effects: Integrates Shery.js (powered by Three.js) to create:

* "Gooey" image distortion effects on hover.

* Magnetic navigation elements.

* A custom skewed mouse follower.

* Interactive Video: Custom video player controls with a dynamic cursor that changes state on interaction.

* Custom Preloader: A GSAP-powered loading screen with a counter and reveal animation.

* Text Effects: Uses Textillate.js and Lettering.js for kinetic typography.

<b>Technologies Used</b>

* HTML5 & CSS3 (Responsive Layouts)

* JavaScript (ES6+)

* GSAP (ScrollTrigger, TweenMax)

* Locomotive Scroll

* Shery.js & Three.js

* Remix Icon

<b>Technical Highlights (Bullet Points)</b><br>
If you want to focus purely on the code skills demonstrated:

* "A frontend development showcase implementing an Awwwards-style website.

* Architecture: Built with vanilla JavaScript, prioritizing performance and direct DOM manipulation.

* Animation Engine: heavily leverages GSAP Timeline for synchronized loading sequences and scroll-triggered reveals.

* UX/UI: Features a custom cursor logic, magnetic buttons, and a responsive layout designed for visual impact.

* Assets: Optimized usage of CDN libraries for Locomotive Scroll and animation utilities."
